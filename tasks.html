            You are building the new Amazon.
            This time you are also responsible for the back office.
            THIS is you CRUD endpoint
            https://strive-school-testing-apis.herokuapp.com/api/product/
            The product model is
            {
                "_id": "5d318e1a8541744830bef139", //SERVER GENERATED
                "name": "app test 1",  //REQUIRED
                "description": "somthing longer", //REQUIRED
                "brand": "nokia", //REQUIRED
                "imageUrl": "https://drop.ndtv.com/TECH/product_database/images/2152017124957PM_635_nokia_3310.jpeg?downsize=*:420&output-quality=80", //REQUIRED
                "price": 100, //REQUIRED
                "userId": "admin", //SERVER GENERATED
                "createdAt": "2019-07-19T09:32:10.535Z", //SERVER GENERATED
                "updatedAt": "2019-07-19T09:32:10.535Z", //SERVER GENERATED
                "__v": 0 //SERVER GENERATED
            }
            EVERY REST API CALL SHOULD BE AUTHENTICATED. You should have received a couple of username and password to use them with basic authentication.
            To use Basic Auth, add to your fetch an header like:
            Authorization: Basic ###########
             'user12':'5s*f!thGyuC8xm&h'
            Where ######### is the base64 version of username:password
            Today you have to implement:
            - A backoffice page, where you can insert the product by specifying the parameters
            - A front page, where the user can see the available products
            You can also start from the previous marketplace.
